# PixGo 

PixGo is a hackathon project built at ETHGlobal.

## What it does
PixGo enables instant conversion of stablecoins into PIX payments in Brazil through a simple wallet interface.

## Problem
Global stablecoin users and protocols cannot easily pay Brazilian users or merchants using PIX.

## Solution
PixGo bridges stablecoin transfers to PIX rails, enabling near-instant local payments.

## Scope (Hackathon MVP)
- One user flow
- One payment demo
- One working transaction or mocked confirmation

## Tech (tentative)
- Frontend: TBD
- Blockchain: TBD
- Payments: PIX (mocked or sandbox)

## Status
Work in progress
